        Lifetime model. The method compute outflow_pdf returns an array year-by-cohort of the probability of a item added to stock in year m (aka cohort m) leaves in in year n. This value equals pdf(n,m).
        This is the only method for the inflow-driven model where the lifetime distribution directly enters the computation. All other stock variables are determined by mass balance.
        The shape of the output pdf array is NoofYears * NoofYears, but the meaning is years by age-cohorts.
        The method does nothing if the pdf alreay exists.

    def compute_sf(self): # survival functions
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Survival table self.sf(m,n) denotes the share of an inflow in year n (age-cohort) still present at the end of year m (after m-n years).
        The computation is self.sf(m,n) = ProbDist.sf(m-n), where ProbDist is the appropriate scipy function for the lifetime model chosen.
        For lifetimes 0 the sf is also 0, meaning that the age-cohort leaves during the same year of the inflow.
        The method compute outflow_sf returns an array year-by-cohort of the surviving fraction of a flow added to stock in year m (aka cohort m) in in year n. This value equals sf(n,m).
        This is the only method for the inflow-driven model where the lifetime distribution directly enters the computation. All other stock variables are determined by mass balance.
        The shape of the output sf array is NoofYears * NoofYears, and the meaning is years by age-cohorts.
        The method does nothing if the sf alreay exists. For example, sf could be assigned to the dynamic stock model from an exogenous computation to save time.

        Convention 1: Stocks are measured AT THE END OF THE YEAR. Flows occur DURING THE YEAR.
        Convention 2: The model time t spans both historic and future age-cohorts, and the index SwitchTime -1 indicates the first future age-cohort.

        In the year SwitchTime the model switches from the historic stock to the stock-driven approach.

        This is the only method for the inflow-driven model where the lifetime distribution directly enters the computation. All other stock variables are determined by mass balance.
        The shape of the output pdf array is NoofYears * NoofYears, but the meaning is years by age-cohorts.

        Survival table self.sf(m,n) denotes the share of an inflow in year n (age-cohort) still present at the end of year m (after m-n years).
        The computation is self.sf(m,n) = ProbDist.sf(m-n), where ProbDist is the appropriate scipy function for the lifetime model chosen.
        For lifetimes 0 the sf is also 0, meaning that the age-cohort leaves during the same year of the inflow.
        The method compute outflow_sf returns an array year-by-cohort of the surviving fraction of a flow added to stock in year m (aka cohort m) in in year n. This value equals sf(n,m).
        This is the only method for the inflow-driven model where the lifetime distribution directly enters the computation. All other stock variables are determined by mass balance.
        The shape of the output sf array is NoofYears * NoofYears, and the meaning is years by age-cohorts.
        The method does nothing if the sf alreay exists. For example, sf could be assigned to the dynamic stock model from an exogenous computation to save time.

        Convention 1: Stocks are measured AT THE END OF THE YEAR. Flows occur DURING THE YEAR.
        Convention 2: The model time t spans both historic and future age-cohorts, and the index SwitchTime -1 indicates the first future age-cohort.

        Convention 4: The future stock time series has 0 as its first len(InitialStock) elements.
        ***
        In the year SwitchTime the model switches from the historic stock to the stock-driven approach. 
        The year SwitchTime is the first year with the stock-driven approach.
